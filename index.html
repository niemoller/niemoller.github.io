        <p>President Trump is refusing to release his taxes, stating that 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/11/politics/trump-tax-returns-answer-news-conference/">nobody cares.</a></p>
        <div class="inset">
        <p><b>"You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, OK? 
            They're the only ones,"</b> President Trump said.</p>
        <p>"You don't think the American public is concerned about it?" the reporter followed up.</p>
        <p><b>"No, I don't think so. I won. And became president,"</b> Trump said. <b>"No, I don't think 
            they care at all. I don't think they care at all. I think you care."</b></p>
        </div>
        <p>We care. Let's do more than just say so on social media.</p>
        <p>The President must disclose his personal finances, including all investments, monetary, and
            corporate interests, and he must do it now.</p>
        <p>Here is a clear and easy action to take.</p>
        <p>If you want to support Senator Warren's request to audit President Trump's finances for
            conflicts of interest, the most effective way to ensure your support will be
            counted is to email two administrators at the U.S. Government Accountability Office, 
            <a href="mailto:siggerudk@gao.gov">Katherine Siggerud (siggerudk@gao.gov)</a> and
            <a href="mailto:minellit@gao.gov">Timothy Minnelli (minellit@gao.gov)</a>. There is 
            a third email address through which they're tracking people who are urging support 
            for the audit: <a href="congrel@gao.gov">congrel@gao.gov</a>. You can also send a 
            single email addressed to all three.</p>
        <p>A suggested email is below</p>

            Subject: Audit of President Trump's Financial Concerns
            Dear Ms. Siggerud and Mr. Minnelli,
            
            Iâ€™m writing in support of Senator Elizabeth Warren's request for an audit of President
            Trump's finances, to prohibit conflicts of interest that would prevent him from carrying
            out the responsibilities of the office without corrupt influence.
            
            Sincerely,
            </pre>
