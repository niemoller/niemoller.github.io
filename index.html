        <p>Trump's martinets of misinformation and lies have stated repeatedly that he will not
            release his tax returns, ever, because "nobody cares" except the media.</p>
        <p>We care. Let's do more than say so on social media.</p>
        <p>This man must disclose his personal finances, including all investments, monetary, and
            corporate interests, and he must do it now.</p>
        <p>Here is clear, easy action to take.</p>
        <p>If you want to support Senator Warren's request to audit President Trump's finances for
            conflicts of interest, the person who answered the phone at the Comptroller General of
            the Government Accountability Office said the most effective way to be sure my support
            counted was to email two administrators, Katherine Siggerud and Timothy Minnelli.</p>
        <p>Their email addresses are:<br/>
            siggerudk@gao.gov<br/>
            minellit@gao.gov</p>
        <p>There is a third email address through which they're tracking people who are urging support 
            for the audit: congrel@gao.gov</p>
        <p>Or, you can send ONE email addressed to: siggerudk@gao.gov, minellit@gao.gov, congrel@gao.gov</p>
        <p><b>Subject line:</b> Re: Audit for President Trump's financial concerns</p>
        <p>Dear Ms. Siggerud and Mr. Minnelli,<br />
            Iâ€™m writing in support of Senator Elizabeth Warren's request for an audit of President <br/>
            Trump's finances, to prohibit conflicts of interest that would prevent him from carrying <br/>
            out the responsibilities of the office without corrupt influence.<br/><br/>
            Sincerely,<br/>
        </p>
